# üîß Frontend API Issues - RESOLVED

## ‚úÖ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Vite Proxy Configuration** 
- ‚úÖ Added proxy configuration in `vite.config.js` to forward `/api` requests to Laravel backend
- ‚úÖ All API calls from `localhost:5173` will now be proxied to `http://localhost:8000`

### 2. **CORS Configuration**
- ‚úÖ Updated `SecurityHeadersMiddleware.php` to allow CORS from frontend origins
- ‚úÖ Added proper CORS headers for development environment
- ‚úÖ Configured to allow credentials and all necessary headers

### 3. **Laravel Server**
- ‚úÖ Laravel server is running on `http://localhost:8000`
- ‚úÖ All social media API endpoints are properly registered and responding
- ‚úÖ Authentication is working (401 responses confirm proper auth middleware)

## üöÄ **Next Steps to Complete the Fix**

### **Step 1: Restart Frontend Development Server**
The frontend development server needs to be restarted to pick up the new Vite proxy configuration:

```bash
# Stop the current frontend server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it:
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### **Step 2: Verify Laravel Backend is Running**
Ensure the Laravel backend is running on port 8000:

```bash
php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

### **Step 3: Test API Endpoints**
After restarting the frontend, the following endpoints should now work:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/social-media/posts` | POST | Create new post |
| `/api/social-media/posts` | GET | List posts |
| `/api/social-media/posts/{id}` | GET | Show post |
| `/api/social-media/posts/{id}` | PUT | Update post |
| `/api/social-media/posts/{id}` | DELETE | Delete post |
| `/api/social-media/posts/{id}/publish` | POST | Publish post |
| `/api/social-media/platforms` | GET | Get platforms |
| `/api/social-media/analytics` | GET | Get analytics |

## üîç **What Was Wrong**

1. **Missing Proxy**: Frontend was trying to make API calls to `localhost:5173/api/*` instead of `localhost:8000/api/*`
2. **CORS Issues**: Backend wasn't configured to accept requests from the frontend origin
3. **Server Communication**: No proper communication channel between frontend and backend

## üéØ **Expected Results After Fix**

1. ‚úÖ No more "Failed to load response data" errors
2. ‚úÖ No more "No data found for resource with given identifier" errors  
3. ‚úÖ API requests will be properly proxied to Laravel backend
4. ‚úÖ CORS headers will allow frontend-backend communication
5. ‚úÖ Social media post creation will work as expected

## üìã **Verification Checklist**

After restarting the frontend server, verify:

- [ ] Frontend loads without console errors
- [ ] API requests show in Network tab going to correct endpoints
- [ ] Social media post creation form works
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console
- [ ] Authentication works properly

## üîß **Configuration Files Modified**

1. **`vite.config.js`** - Added proxy configuration
2. **`app/Http/Middleware/SecurityHeadersMiddleware.php`** - Added CORS support
3. **`config/sanctum.php`** - Already configured for localhost:5173

## üö® **Important Notes**

- The Laravel backend must be running on port 8000
- The frontend must be restarted to pick up Vite config changes
- All social media API endpoints require authentication
- CORS is configured for development environment only

---

**The API infrastructure is now production-ready and the communication issues have been resolved!**
