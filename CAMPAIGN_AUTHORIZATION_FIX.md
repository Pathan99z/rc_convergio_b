# 🚨 Campaign Authorization Issue - FIXED

## 🎯 **Issue Identified & Resolved**

### **Problem**: "This action is unauthorized" Error
**Root Cause**: The `CampaignPolicy::send()` method was blocking campaigns with status `'sent'` from being scheduled/resent
**Solution**: Updated the policy to allow scheduling of sent campaigns

## 🔧 **Technical Fix Applied**

### **File**: `app/Policies/CampaignPolicy.php`

### **Before (Problematic Code):**
```php
public function send(User $user, Campaign $campaign): bool
{
    // Only allow sending if campaign is in draft status
    if ($campaign->status !== 'draft') {
        return false;  // ❌ This blocked sent campaigns
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

### **After (Fixed Code):**
```php
public function send(User $user, Campaign $campaign): bool
{
    // Allow sending if campaign is in draft status
    if ($campaign->status === 'draft') {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Allow scheduling if campaign is in sent status (for resending/scheduling)
    if ($campaign->status === 'sent') {
        return true;  // ✅ Now allows sent campaigns
    }
    
    // Allow sending if campaign is in scheduled status (for rescheduling)
    if ($campaign->status === 'scheduled') {
        return true;  // ✅ Now allows scheduled campaigns
    }
    
    return false; // Block sending for other statuses
}
```

## 📊 **Authorization Rules (Updated)**

### **✅ Now ALLOWED:**
- **`draft`** campaigns → Can be sent/scheduled
- **`sent`** campaigns → Can be resent/rescheduled  
- **`scheduled`** campaigns → Can be rescheduled

### **❌ Still BLOCKED:**
- **`sending`** campaigns → Cannot be sent (already in progress)
- **`cancelled`** campaigns → Cannot be sent (cancelled)

## 🧪 **Test Results**

```
Campaign status 'draft': ✅ ALLOWED
Campaign status 'sent': ✅ ALLOWED
Campaign status 'scheduled': ✅ ALLOWED
Campaign status 'sending': ❌ BLOCKED
Campaign status 'cancelled': ❌ BLOCKED

Found sent campaign: ID 17, Status: sent
Can send sent campaign: ✅ YES
```
